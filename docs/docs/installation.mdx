# Installation

Angler is currently supported on Linux and is available for the ROS distributions
Humble and Iron. Angler can be installed from source or using one of
the provided Docker images. If you plan to use Angler for simulation and have
a system with limited compute power, we recommend installing Angler from source.
For all other cases, we recommend installing Angler using Docker.

## Docker installation

Prior to installing Angler using Docker, make sure that Docker is installed on
your system and that you are logged into the GitHub Container Registry. If
Docker is not installed, you may follow the instructions provided
[here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you are not already logged into
the GitHub Container Registry, please do so by following the instructions
provided [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
Once you have successfully installed Docker and logged into the GitHub Container
Registry, you can install Angler by pulling one of the provided [Docker
images](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/angler/pkgs/container/angler).
A complete list of the provided images is documented below (where `*` should be
replaced with the desired ROS distribution, e.g., `humble-robot`):

| Supported ROS Versions | Image Tag         | Build Architectures | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Humble, Iron           | \*-robot          | `amd64`, `arm64`    | A bare-bones image that includes all dependencies without simulation or visualization features. This can be used to deploy Angler to hardware.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Humble, Iron           | \*-desktop        | `amd64`             | Image that includes all dependencies, including simulation and visualization features. This can be used for development, testing, and top-side deployment.                                                                                                                                           |
| Humble, Iron           | \*-desktop-nvidia | `amd64`             | Extension of the `*-desktop` image that provides support for NVIDIA GPU drivers. This image is _strongly_ recommended for systems that have an NVIDIA GPU, and requires the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). |

### Development container

We recommend using one of the provided Visual Studio Code
[development containers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/angler/tree/main/.devcontainer)
to implement and test your own packages. These containers use the `*-desktop`
and `*-desktop-nvidia` images as base images. To use the development containers,
first verify that you can run Visual Studio Code inside a Docker container by
following the tutorial provided [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).
Once you have successfully verified that you can run Visual Studio Code inside a
Docker container, open the Angler repository in Visual Studio Code and select the option
to reopen the folder inside a container when prompted. This will automatically
build the development container and install all necessary dependencies. Once the
container is built, you can start developing your own packages!

## Source installation

We recommend using the project [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/angler/blob/main/.docker/Dockerfile)
(beginning at the `robot` stage) for complete source installation details. This
installation may be customized according to your specific needs. For example,
if you do not plan to use the simulation environment, you may forego installing
Gazebo and its dependencies.
